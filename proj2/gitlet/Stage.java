/** Represents a gitlet stage object.
 *
 *  Description: Adds a copy of the file as it currently exists to the staging area (see the
 *  description of the commit command). For this reason, adding a file is also called staging
 *  the file for addition. Staging an already-staged file overwrites the previous entry in the
 *  staging area with the new contents. The staging area should be somewhere in .gitlet. If the
 *  current working version of the file is identical to the version in the current commit, do
 *  not stage it to be added, and remove it from the staging area if it is already there (as can
 *  happen when a file is changed, added, and then changed back to itâ€™s original version). The
 *  file will no longer be staged for removal (see gitlet rm), if it was at the time of the command.
 *
 *  IMPORTANT: The staging files should be named after its file name not sha1 hash name
